Calculator,This is my first project for my internship at OASIS  INFOBYTE, where I created a responsive calculator using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a platform to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the calculator allows users to calculate percentages. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Users can input numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons and view the result instantly. The calculator also features a history display, showing the input and result of previous calculations. Overall, the Simple Calculator project demonstrates the use of fundamental web technologies to create a practical tool for performing arithmetic calculations.
